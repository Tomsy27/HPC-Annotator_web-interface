The aim of the project is to create a user interface that simplifies the configuration of HPC-Annotator software, which is a parallelization software for the main annotation software such as BLAST and Diamond, among others. 
The interface should allow the user to customize the software settings in order to generate a software package with the desired specifications. 
Once the software package is created, the user will be able to download it in TAR format and upload it onto the machine where the annotation will take place.
